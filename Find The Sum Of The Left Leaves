Problem statement

Given a binary tree with ‘root’. Your task is to find the sum of all the left leaf nodes.

Properties of leaf:-

In a binary tree, a leaf is a node such that it does not have any children. Node ‘1’ is always the root of the binary tree. Left leaves are those nodes that are the left child of their parent and a leaf node.

Example:

Let’s say you have a binary tree as follows:-

Node 4 and Node 5 are leaf nodes and left child of their parent. Node 6 is a leaf node but not the left child of its parent node 3. Therefore return ‘4+5= 9’ as the answer.

Note:

You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 1000

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases.‘N’ is the number of nodes in the binary tree.  

Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1:
2
1 2 -1 3 -1 -1 -1
1 2 3 4 -1 -1 5 6 -1 -1 7 -1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 1:
3
6

Sample Output 1 Explanation:

Test case 1:

Node 3 is a left leaf.

Therefore the answer is 3.

Test case 2:

Node 7 is a leaf node but it is not the left child of their parent. Node 6 is a leaf node and the left child of its parent node 4.

Therefore the answer is 6.

Sample Input 2:
2
1 2 3 4 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 2 -1 -1 -1

Sample Output 2:
4
2
