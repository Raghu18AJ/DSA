Problem statement
You are given a string ‘S’ representing a date in the “Day Month Year” format, where:

1. Day is represented as {"1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th",”5th”, ...,”29th”, "30th", "31st"}.

2. Month is represented as {"Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"}.

3. Year is represented as {2020,2021 etc}
Your task is to convert the given date into “YYYY-MM-DD” format, where:
1. YYYY is a 4 digit year.

2. MM is a 2 digit month.

3. DD is a 2 digit day.
Note:

1. The given dates are guaranteed to be valid.

2. If you can’t represent a month in 2 digits then append  0 in front of the month. Eg: if the month is Jan, represent it as 01 and not as 1 in the answer.

3. If you can’t represent a day in 2 digits then append 0 in front of the day. Eg: if the day is 5, represent it as 05 and not as 5 in the answer.
