Problem statement

Ninja is given a pattern. Now he is asked to print the same pattern for any given ‘N’ number of rows.

Note:

There is only one space between the values of each column in a row.

For example, Pattern for ‘N’ = 5 will be.
1 2 3 4 5 
11 12 13 14 15 
21 22 23 24 25 
16 17 18 19 20 
6 7 8 9 10 

Sample Input1 :
1 
5
Sample Output2 :
1 2 3 4 5 
11 12 13 14 15 
21 22 23 24 25 
16 17 18 19 20 
6 7 8 9 10 
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
For test case 1:
We print the given pattern for the given 5 rows where each row has different values in increasing order with a difference in the value of 1 between each element and 1 space between each column in a row.

Sample Input2 :
1
4
Sample Output2 :
1 2 3 4
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
5 6 7 8
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
For test case 1:
We print the given pattern for the given 4 rows where each row has different values in increasing order with a difference of 1 in the value of 1 between each element and 1 space between each column in a row.

cpp code:
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
vector<string> printPattern(int n)
{
	// Write your code here
	vector<string> ans(n);
	int total = n*n;
	int count = 1;
	int i = 0;
	int j = n-1;
	while(count<=total && i<j){
		string s1 = "";
		for(int k = 0;k<n;k++){
			string ch = to_string(count);
			s1 += ch;
			s1.push_back(' ');
			count++;
		}
		ans[i] = s1;

		string s2 = "";
		for(int l = 0;l<n;l++){
			string ch = to_string(count);
			s2 += ch;
			s2.push_back(' ');
			count++;
		}
		ans[j] = s2;
		i++;
		j--;
	}
	if(i==j){
		string s1 = "";
		for(int k = 0;k<n;k++){
			string ch = to_string(count);
			s1 += ch;
			s1.push_back(' ');
			count++;
		}
		ans[i] = s1;
	}
	return ans;

}
