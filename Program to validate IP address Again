Problem statement

You are given the text ‘IPAddress’. Your task is to check if the given text ‘IPAddress’ is a valid ‘IPv4’ or not.

Conditions for a valid ‘IPv4’ are:

1. Text form of ‘IPAddress’ must be ‘a.b.c.d’
2. The values of a,b,c and d can vary from ‘0’ to ‘255’ and both ‘0’ and ‘255’ are inclusive.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10^4
1 <= length of given text <= 50

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
4
123.111.12.k
122.0.330.0
1.1.1.250
1.0.0.0.1
Sample Output 1:
False
False
True
False
Explanation of sample input 1:
Test Case 1:
Given text ‘IPAddress = 123.111.12.k’, it is satisfying the first condition that given ‘IPAddress’ must be ‘a.b.c.d’ formed but it not satisfying the second condition that d must in a range of ‘0’ to ‘255’ but the value of ‘d’ is ‘k’.
Hence return ‘False’.

Test Case 2:
Given text ‘IPAddress = 122.0.330.0’, it is satisfying the first condition that given ‘IPAddress’ must be ‘a.b.c.d’ formed but it not satisfying the second condition that c must in a range of ‘0’ to ‘255’ but the value of ‘c’ is ‘330’ and it is out of range.
Hence return ‘False’.

Test Case 3:
Given text ‘IPAddress = 1.1.1.250’, it is satisfying the first condition that given ‘IPAddress’ must be ‘a.b.c.d’ formed as well as it satisfying the second condition that a,b,c, and d must in range of ‘0’ to ‘250’.
Hence return ‘True’.

Test Case 4:
Given text ‘IPAddress = 1.0.0.0.1’, it is not satisfying the first condition for valid ‘IPv4’, that text ‘IPAddress’ must be in form of ‘a.b.c.d’ but given text is a form of ‘a.b.c.d.e’
Hence return ‘False’.

Sample Input 2:
2
1.90.21.1
1.1
Sample Output 2:
True

cpp code:
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
bool isValidIPv4(string ipAddress) {
    // Write your code here.
    int dots = 0;
    for(int i = 0;i<ipAddress.length();i++){
        if(ipAddress[i]=='.'){
            dots++;
        }else{
            if(!(ipAddress[i]>='0'&&ipAddress[i]<='9')){
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    if(dots!=3){
        return false;
    }
    int i = 0;
    int temp = 0;
    while(i<ipAddress.length()){
        if(ipAddress[i]=='.'){
            if(!(temp>=0&&temp<=255)){
                return false;
            }
            temp = 0;
        }
        else{
            char ch = ipAddress[i];
            temp *= 10;
            temp += ch-'0';
        }
        i++;
    }
    if(!(temp>=0&&temp<=255)){
        return false;
    }
    return true;

}
False
