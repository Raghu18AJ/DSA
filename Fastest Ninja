Problem statement

After the pandemic ended, Alice and Bob finally got the chance to play some outdoor games. They decided to play “Fastest Ninja” along with their ‘N’ other friends. The game is as follows,

1. Bob and Alice are standing at coordinates (0, 0) and (‘X’, ‘Y’), respectively, in the X-Y plane.

2. All the other ‘N’ friends are standing at some coordinates in the X-Y plane. The starting positions of all the ‘N’ friends are given as a 2 - Dimensional array of integers ‘positions’, where ‘position[i]’ denotes the starting position of the i-th friend.

3. In one move, Bob and his ‘N’ friends can independently choose to do one of the following two things:

    1. Stay at their current position.

    2. Move to any of the four neighboring positions, i.e., for any (x, y) move to north(x, y + 1), south(x, y - 1), east(x + 1, y), or west(x - 1, y).

To win the game, Bob has to reach Alice before any of his ‘N’ friends catches him. As Bob’s friend, your task is to tell him whether he can win the game or not.

Note:

All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane

There can be multiple friends with the same starting position(including Alice and Bob).

Bob and his ‘N’ friends move simultaneously.

Bob loses if he reaches any coordinate(including Alice’s position) at the same time as any of his ‘N’ friends.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 5000
-10 ^ 7 <= X, Y <= 10 ^ 7
-10 ^ 7 <= position[i][0], position[i][1] <= 10 ^ 7

Time Limit: 1 sec

Explanation For Sample Input 1:

Test Case 1 :  

Starting positions of Bob and his three friends are marked in orange and red color, respectively. The position of Alice is marked with green color.

Bob cannot win, as his friend at (1, 1) can reach Alice before him.

Test Case 2 :     

Starting positions of Bob and his four friends are marked in orange and red color, respectively. The position of Alice is marked with green color.

No one can reach Alice before Bob. Hence he will win the game.

cpp code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
bool fastestNinja(int n, int x, int y, vector<vector<int>> &position) {
	// Write your code here
	int target = abs(x)+abs(y);
	for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
		int temp = abs(x-position[i][0])+abs(y-position[i][1]);
		if(temp<=target){
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;

}
