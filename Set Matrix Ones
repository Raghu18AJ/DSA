Average time to solve is 15m

Problem statement

You have been given a non-empty grid ‘MAT’ consisting of only 0s and 1s. Your task is to modify it in such a way that if a cell has value 1 (MAT[i][j] == 1), then all the cells of the i-th row and j-th column should be changed to 1.

For Example
If the given grid is this:
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1]

Then the modified grid will be
[0, 0, 1],
[1, 1, 1]

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= M <= 50
0 <= MAT[i][j] <= 1

Time limit: 1 sec

Sample Output 1:
1 1
1 0
1 1
Explanation of the Sample Input 1
Test Case 1: For the given grid, the element in the first row and column is 1, thus all the elements in the first row and first column are set to 1.

Test Case 2: For the given grid, there is only one row and the element in this row is 1, thus all elements in the grid are set to 1.

cpp code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
void setMatrixOnes(vector<vector<int>> &MAT, int n, int m)
{
    // Write your code here.
    set<int> rows;
    set<int> cols;
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j = 0;j<m;j++){
            if(MAT[i][j]==1){
                rows.insert(i);
                cols.insert(j);
            }
        }
    }
    for(auto i:rows){
        for(int j = 0;j<m;j++){
            MAT[i][j] =1;
        }
    }

    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        for(auto j:cols){
            MAT[i][j] = 1;
        }
    }
}
