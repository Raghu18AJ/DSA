Problem statement
Ninja has been given two sparse matrices ‘MAT1’ and ‘MAT2’ of integers having size ‘N’ x ‘M’ and ‘M’ x ‘P’, respectively.

A sparse matrix is a matrix that contains very few non-zero elements.

Ninja has to find the matrix formed by the multiplication of ‘MAT1’ and ‘MAT2’. As Ninja is busy with some other tasks so he needs your help. Can you help Ninja to find the matrix formed by the multiplication of ‘MAT1’ and ‘MAT2’?

Note: The number of columns in ‘MAT1’ i.e ‘M’ is equal to the number of rows in ‘MAT2’ i.e ‘M’. It means we can always multiply ‘MAT1’ with ‘MAT2’.

For example:

For the ‘MAT1’ and ‘MAT2’ given below, ‘MAT3’ is the matrix formed by multiplying ‘MAT1’ and ‘MAT2’. 

1. MAT3[0][0] = MAT1[0][0] * MAT2[0][0] + MAT1[0][1] * MAT2[1][0]  ie. 2 * 1 + 1 * 4 = 6
2. MAT3[1][0] = MAT1[1][0] * MAT2[1][0] + MAT1[1][1] * MAT2[1][0] ie. 0 * 6 + 0 * 4 = 0

Constraints:
1 <= ‘T’ <= 100
1 <= ‘N’, ‘M’ and ‘P’ <= 100
-10^5 <= ‘MAT1[i][j]’ and ‘MAT2[i][j]’ <= 10^5

Sample Input 1:
1
2 1 1 2
2
0
1 2
Sample Output 1:
2 4
0 0
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
For sample test case 1: 
1. MAT3[0][0] = MAT1[0][0] * MAT2[0][0] ie. 2 * 1 = 2
2. MAT3[0][1] = MAT1[0][0] * MAT2[0][1] ie. 2 * 2 = 4
3. MAT3[1][0] = MAT1[0][1] * MAT2[0][0] ie. 0 * 1 = 0 
4. MAT3[1][1] = MAT1[1][1] * MAT2[0][1] ie. 0 * 2 = 0
Sample Input 2:
2
1 1 1 2
3
1 0
1 1 1 1
-1
7
Sample Output 2:
3 0
-7
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
For sample test case 1: 
1. MAT3[0][0] = MAT1[0][0] * MAT2[0][0] ie. 3 * 1 = 3
2. MAT3[0][1] = MAT1[0][0] * MAT2[0][1] ie. 3 * 0 = 0

For sample test case 2: 
1. MAT3[0][0] = MAT1[0][0] * MAT2[0][0] ie. -1 * 7 = -7

cpp code:
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
vector<vector<int>> multiplyMatrices(vector<vector<int>> &mat1, vector<vector<int>> &mat2)
{
    // Write your code here.
    int n = mat1.size();
    int m = mat1[0].size();
    int p = mat2[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> ans(n,vector<int>(p,0));
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j = 0;j<m;j++){
            for(int k = 0;k<p;k++){
                ans[i][k] += mat1[i][j]*mat2[j][k];
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
