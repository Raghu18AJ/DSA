Problem statement
Ninja is given a pattern. Now he is asked to print the same pattern for any given ‘N’ number of rows.

Note:

There is only one space between the values of each column in a row.

For example, Pattern for ‘N’ = 5 will be.
1 2 3 4 5 
11 12 13 14 15 
21 22 23 24 25 
16 17 18 19 20 
6 7 8 9 10 
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input1 :
1 
5
Sample Output2 :
1 2 3 4 5 
11 12 13 14 15 
21 22 23 24 25 
16 17 18 19 20 
6 7 8 9 10 
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
For test case 1:
We print the given pattern for the given 5 rows where each row has different values in increasing order with a difference in the value of 1 between each element and 1 space between each column in a row.
Sample Input2 :
1
4
Sample Output2 :
1 2 3 4
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
5 6 7 8
Explanation of Sample Input 2:
For test case 1:
We print the given pattern for the given 4 rows where each row has different values in increasing order with a difference of 1 in the value of 1 between each element and 1 space between each column in a row.


cpp code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
vector<string> printPattern(int n)
{
	// Write your code here
    vector<string> ans(n);
    int count = 1;
    int start = 0;
    int end = n-1;
    bool checkStart = true;
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        string temp = "";
        for(int j = 0;j<n;j++){
            string st = to_string(count);
            count++;
            temp += st;
            if(j<n-1){
                temp += " ";
            }
        }
        if(checkStart){
            ans[start] = temp;
            start++;
        }
        else{
            ans[end] = temp;
            end--;
        }
        checkStart = !checkStart;
    }
    return ans;
}
