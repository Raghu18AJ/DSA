Problem statement

As a part of its competition, the school will conduct a codeathon, Lock the Code, where it has been given a value, and the participants have to decode it.

The participants are given a value denoting the number of rows in the matrix; they need to print the pattern.

Example : 

For N=5, Pattern:
E
DE
CDE
BCDE
ABCDE 

Among the participants, Ninja is new to programming and doesn’t have much experience; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 26

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
2
5
4

Sample Output 1:
E
DE
CDE
BCDE
ABCDE

D
CD
BCD
ABCD

Explanation for Sample Input 1:
In the first test case, value of ‘N’ is 5, so print the ‘N’ rows from 1 to ‘N’ where in each row start from (N - i - 1)the character which goes on till ‘Nth character. Hence the answer is [‘E’,’DE’,’CDE,’ BCDE’,’ABCDE’].

In the second test case, the value of ‘N’ is 4, so print the ‘N’ rows from 1 to ‘N’ where each row starts from (N - i - 1)the character, which goes on till ‘Nth character. Hence the answer is [‘D’,’CD’,BCD’,’ABCD’].

Sample Input 2:
2
3
2

Sample Output 2:
C
BC
ABC

B
AB

cpp code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
void reverseVec(vector<char> &arr){
    int i = 0;
    int j = arr.size()-1;
    while(i<=j){
        swap(arr[i],arr[j]);
        i++;
        j--;
    }
}
vector<vector<char>> interestingPattern(int n)
{
    // Write your code here
    vector<vector<char>> ans;
    for(int i = 1;i<=n;i++){
        vector<char> temp;
        int j = 0;
        while(j<i){
            char ch = 'A'+n-1-j;
            temp.push_back(ch);
            j++;
        }
        reverseVec(temp);
        ans.push_back(temp);

    }
    return ans;
}
