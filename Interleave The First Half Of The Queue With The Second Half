Problem statement
You have been given a queue of integers. You need to rearrange the elements of the queue by interleaving the elements of the first half of the queue with the second half.

Note :
The given queue will always be of even length.
For example :
If N= 10
and Q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
then the output will be
 Q = [10, 60, 20, 70, 30, 80, 40, 90, 50, 100]
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10^2
2 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= data <= 10^4
Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases, “data” is the value of the element of the queue.
Sample Input 1:
1
10
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Sample Output 1:
10 60 20 70 30 80 40 90 50 100
Sample Input 2:
1
6
10 20 30 40 50 60 
Sample Output 2:
10 40 20 50 30 60 

cpp code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
void interLeaveQueue(queue < int > & q) {
    // Write your code here.
    queue<int> first;
    queue<int> second;
    int n = q.size();
    int count = 0;
    while(count<n/2){
        first.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
        count++;
    }
    while(count<n){
        second.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
        count++;
    }
    while(!first.empty()){
        q.push(first.front());
        q.push(second.front());

        first.pop();
        second.pop();

    }
    
}
